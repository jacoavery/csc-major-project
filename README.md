## README.md
The proposed solution is a web-based application that allows users to create a login and input their skill level as a rower, which will provide them with videos and explanations on how to improve their ability on the erg. The application also offers advice on how to prepare for races and erg tests and allows multiple rowers and coaches to create group chats to schedule training sessions and major tests. The proposed solution aims to provide a more convenient way of scheduling training and preventing injuries, teaching newcomers/novices how to use the erg properly, without injury, and improve over time. The benefits of the proposed solution include preventing injuries, which is a common issue with off-water training, simplifying scheduling issues through the use of a calendar and group chats, and offering coaching and training advice for rowers of all skill levels. The application also provides a comprehensive guide on erg technique, how to warm up and down, and the benefits of erging for health and fitness. This proposal is the best solution for the client's needs because it addresses the key issues faced by rowers, including injury prevention, scheduling, and lack of coaching. The application's use of videos and explanations, as well as its group chat feature, ensures that users receive tailored coaching and training advice, which will improve their erging abilities over time. The calendar feature also simplifies scheduling, making it easier for coaches and rowers to plan training sessions and major tests and races.
