The proposed project is a web-based application that aims to simplify the process of scheduling training and preventing injuries while also providing coaching and training advice for rowers of all skill levels. The application will allow users to create a login and input their skill level as a rower, which will provide them with videos and explanations on how to improve their ability on the erg. The application also offers advice on how to prepare for races and erg tests and allows multiple rowers and coaches to create group chats to schedule training sessions and major tests.The problem that the proposed project aims to address is the lack of an easy and convenient way for rowers to schedule their training sessions, as well as the lack of coaching and training advice for rowers of all skill levels. Additionally, the project aims to address the issue of injuries that often arise from off-water training. These injuries can have a significant impact on the rower's ability to train and compete, and in some cases, can even lead to long-term health problems. The proposed solution to these problems is a web-based application that provides a comprehensive guide on erg technique, how to warm up and down, and the benefits of erging for health and fitness. The application also provides a platform for multiple rowers and coaches to create group chats where they can schedule training sessions and major tests. Users will be able to input their skill level as a rower, and the application will provide them with personalized coaching and training advice based on their current abilities. One of the main benefits of the proposed solution is the prevention of injuries that are commonly associated with off-water training. The application will provide users with information on how to prevent injuries, what might cause them, stretches which can help prevent issues, how to warm up properly on and off water, how to warm down, and what lactic acid is and how it works. By following the guidelines provided by the application, users will be able to train effectively without putting their bodies at risk of injury. Another significant benefit of the proposed solution is the simplification of scheduling issues. The application provides a calendar feature that will allow users to set up their training schedule for the season. Additionally, the group chat feature will allow users to post ergs to coaches and compare times and split with friends. This feature will enable rowers and coaches to work together more efficiently, allowing for a better overall training experience. The application will also provide coaching and training advice for rowers of all skill levels. The use of videos and explanations, as well as the personalized coaching and training advice provided based on the user's current abilities, ensures that users receive tailored coaching and training advice, which will improve their erging abilities over time. This coaching and training advice will be beneficial for both newcomers and experienced rowers who want to improve their technique and ability on the erg. In conclusion, the proposed web-based application is an excellent solution to the problems faced by rowers, including injury prevention, scheduling, and lack of coaching. The application's use of videos and explanations, as well as its group chat feature, ensures that users receive tailored coaching and training advice, which will improve their erging abilities over time. The calendar feature also simplifies scheduling, making it easier for coaches and rowers to plan training sessions and major tests and races. Overall, the proposed solution is an innovative and practical solution that will provide significant benefits for rowers of all skill levels.
