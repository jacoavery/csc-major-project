## README.md

The text describes a proposed web-based application that aims to solve several issues faced by rowers, including injury prevention, scheduling, and lack of coaching. The application will allow users to input their skill level and provide them with videos and explanations on how to improve their ability on the erg. Additionally, it will offer advice on how to prepare for races and erg tests, and allow multiple rowers and coaches to create group chats for scheduling training sessions and major tests. The proposed solution aims to provide a more convenient way of scheduling training and teaching newcomers/novices how to use the erg properly, without injury, and improve over time. The benefits of the proposed solution include preventing injuries, simplifying scheduling issues, and offering tailored coaching and training advice. However, it is unclear how the application will be developed and implemented, and whether it will effectively address the problems faced by rowers. The text raises several questions about the feasibility, effectiveness, and user adoption of the proposed solution, highlighting the need for further research and testing.
