## Introduction:
My project proposal is a web based application (name not chosen) which web-based will allow users to create a login and input where they see themselves as a rower (novice, second year, third year, etc) due to what user inputs will provide them with videos and explanations on how they can improve their ability on the erg. I will also work alongside people who have had thirty-plus years of experience in erging and rowing. With advice on how to prepare for races and erg tests like 2k, 4k, and hour-long ergs. Whilst also allowing multiple rowers and coaches to create group chats where they can schedule upcoming training sessions and major tests. My goal for this app is to provide an easier, simpler way to schedule training with the use of a calendar instead of going week by week.


###  Problem Statement:
The problem that I aim to address and solve is creating a much more convenient way of scheduling training and helping /teaching those who want to learn how to erg in depth but do not know how to start. See here for research on injuries from off-water training and biomechanics produced by Timothy M. Hosea University Orthopaedic Associates, LLC, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jerseyâ€“Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, New Jersey & Jo A. Hannafin Hospital for Special Surgery, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, New York, [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23016093/)


### Proposed Solution:
To solve this problem of preventing injuries, scheduling issues and teaching newcomers / novices. Preventing Injuries; how to prevent injuries, what might cause them, stretches which can help prevent issues, how to warm up properly on and off water, how to warm down what lactic acid is, how it works. Scheduling Issues; using a calendar to set up training for the seasons and having a group chat where people can post ergs to coaches and compare times and split with friends. Teaching newcomers / Novices; how to use an erg properly, how to use without injury benefits for health and fitness, and how to improve over a period of time.


### Conclusion:
The proposed solution is a web-based application that allows users to create a login and input their skill level as a rower, which will provide them with videos and explanations on how to improve their ability on the erg. The application also offers advice on how to prepare for races and erg tests and allows multiple rowers and coaches to create group chats to schedule training sessions and major tests. The proposed solution aims to provide a more convenient way of scheduling training and preventing injuries, teaching newcomers/novices how to use the erg properly, without injury, and improve over time. The benefits of the proposed solution include preventing injuries, which is a common issue with off-water training, simplifying scheduling issues through the use of a calendar and group chats, and offering coaching and training advice for rowers of all skill levels. The application also provides a comprehensive guide on erg technique, how to warm up and down, and the benefits of erging for health and fitness. This proposal is the best solution for the client's needs because it addresses the key issues faced by rowers, including injury prevention, scheduling, and lack of coaching. The application's use of videos and explanations, as well as its group chat feature, ensures that users receive tailored coaching and training advice, which will improve their erging abilities over time. The calendar feature also simplifies scheduling, making it easier for coaches and rowers to plan training sessions and major tests and races.
